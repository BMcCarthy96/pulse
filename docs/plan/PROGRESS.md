# Build Progress

Update this file at every phase completion. One section per phase; check off acceptance
criteria with a one-line verification note. Deviations from reference docs get logged here too.

## Deviation log

- **Phase 0**: `create-next-app@latest` resolved Next 16 by default; pinned `next`/`react`/
  `react-dom` back to the 15.x/19.x lines to match the locked stack table.
- **Phase 1**: Initial migration was created via `prisma migrate diff --from-empty` +
  `prisma migrate resolve --applied` instead of `prisma migrate dev`. Reason: `migrate dev`
  detected drift against the already-seeded local dev DB (created via an earlier `db push`)
  and required `migrate reset`, which Prisma's own safety guard blocked without explicit user
  consent for a destructive action — and it would have discarded the freshly seeded demo data
  for no benefit. The diff+resolve approach produces an identical committed migration file
  without any data loss.
- **Phase 1**: Seed produces ~60 DEAD jobs (vs. the doc's "20-30") because job failures inside
  the two bad-afternoon clusters independently roll a chance of exhausting retries, on top of
  the 20-30 explicitly-seeded DEAD jobs. Still well within "failed-job queue is non-empty on
  first login"; not adjusted further.
